For now this repository contains an ongoing work on TML (Tau Meta-Language), a Partial Evaluator (Futamura's style) to PFP (Partial Fixed Points, those logics that capture PSPACE over finite ordered structures).

To build the code simply run `make` and then to run the example simply do `./tml < example`

Can find us on ##idni @freenode
