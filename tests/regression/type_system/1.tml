# Transitive closure (TC)
#
# TC of a directed graph is simply another
# directed graph representing paths
# in the original graph.
#
# This is a classical example of recursion.
#
# Let's have a directed graph represented by
# following 'e' relation:


record e {  int:2 ?a. char ?b.}
record tc {int:3 ?a. int:7 ?b.}

e(1 2).
e(2 3).
e(3 4).
e(4 5).
e(5 1).
e(8 9).

tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?y).

tc(?x ?y) :- tc(?x ?z), e(?z ?y).
