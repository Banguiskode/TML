# Transitive closure (TC)
#
# TC of a directed graph is simply another
# directed graph representing paths
# in the original graph.
#
# This is a classical example of recursion.
#
# Let's have a directed graph represented by
# following 'e' relation:

predtype e( int:4 ?a,  int:4 ?b).
#predtype tc ( int:4 ?a, int:4 ?b).

e(2 2).
#tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?y).
kz(?a ?b) :- ?x = ?a, ?x =?y, ?y = ?b, e(?x ?y).
#kz(?a ?b) :- ?a = ?b, e(?a ?b).
